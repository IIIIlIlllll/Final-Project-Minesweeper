Project Vision
We want to realize the classic game "Minesweeper". This is a logic-based puzzle game. The objective of the game is to clear the board without triggering any mines by using the numerical clues indicating the number of adjacent mines

How will someone use your project?
Users will use the j keyboard to control and interact with the game.Enter the coordinates to select the cell. Enter "flag" and â€œremove_flag" along with coordinates to place or remove marks on suspicious landmines.
At the beginning, the user will input the difficulty level (for example, easy, medium, hard), which will determine the size of the chessboard and the number of mines



What are the three features you want to build?
Reveal algorithms (complex logic)
When the user clicks on the blank area, this function will display all adjacent empty cells. It will also correctly display the numbered cells to indicate how many landmines are nearby.

Game end and victory check
We will develop a feature to detect when a player touches a landmine (game ends) or successfully clears all non-landmine cells (victory).

Display map 
Use list to display cell, displayed numbers, marked cells and landmines.

GUI display(maybe)
We will design a GUI to draw a minesweeper map based on the selected difficulty level. This GUI will display the map, displayed numbers, marked grids and landmines. It will also display the screen at the end of the game, including Windows for victory and defeat.


Language
We will be implementing this in Python.
